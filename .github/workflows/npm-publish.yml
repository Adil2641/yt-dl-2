Here's your updated GitHub Actions workflow file with the **"Run workflow" button** enabled by adding the `workflow_dispatch` trigger:

```yaml
# This workflow will run tests using node and then publish a package to GitHub Packages when a release is created
# It also supports manual triggering via the Run button.
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/publishing-packages/publishing-nodejs-packages

name: Node.js Package

on:
  release:
    types: [created]
  workflow_dispatch:  # ðŸ‘ˆ Enables the Run button in the GitHub Actions UI

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test

  publish-npm:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          registry-url: https://registry.npmjs.org/
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm publish
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.npm_token }}
```

### âœ… Now this workflow:

* **Automatically runs on release creation**
* **Can also be triggered manually** from the GitHub Actions tab using the **"Run workflow"** button.
